It is sorta cringe to share your opinions on the internet cause
it just is but if you don't then you will just die and no one will care
This is actually so deep...

Yeah I basically just remade some of my favorite boardgames

I'm not gonna remake chess cause Im lazy and it has been made 100x better a bunch of times
Connect 4: The animation is sort of doodoo but it is lowkey fine
Quoridor: Fun game because you just make life harder for other people but sometimes it makes your 
life harder too, actually metaphor for real life
Boggle: You look for words and sometimes there will be a good one, but also the dictionary I'm using
has no plurals and missing a ton of words ending in ed, so if you find a good word then it probably isn't
even in there, but maybe you can still find something cool
Blokus: Work in progress, actually the hardest one so far cause I don't know how to drag and drop in js
and I've figured it out, I mean it was actually pretty easy, but I was just being a cheeseball
AND
Something cool that everyone probably knows, but I just thought of today (hopefully not wrong)
(turn % x) + 1
will get you 1 through x
just like how (turn + 1) % x gets you 0 thru x -1
also you can't name a variable the same thing as your function????
